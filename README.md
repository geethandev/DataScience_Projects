## Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of my data science projects. Each subfolder represents a different project, focusing on various topics and datasets. Each project includes a detailed README file that provides an in-depth explanation of the project's purpose, data sources, methodologies, results, and conclusions.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- [Project 1](/project1/): [Brief description of project 1]
- [Project 2](/project2/): [Brief description of project 2]
- [Project 3](/project3/): [Brief description of project 3]
- [Project 4](/project4/): [Brief description of project 4]
- [Project 5](/project5/): [Brief description of project 5]
- ...

Each project folder contains the necessary files, such as Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and additional resources.

## How to Use

To explore a specific project, navigate to its corresponding subfolder and read the project's README file for a comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives, methodologies, and results. You can also run the Jupyter Notebooks to interact with the code and data.
